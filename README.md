# the Ultimate GTM debug setup

A container and custom template tag to debug and monitor your GTM setup.

It contains DEBUG tags, triggers and variables to debug the dataLayer into a GA profile of your choice, and capture lots of custom dimensions and site speed metrics. *More documentation will follow*.

## Template tag
The Template Tag in this container is a slightly modified version of the one I made last year, which is here:

It sends Tag Monitor info to Google Analytics via the Measurement Protocol (enhanced ecommerce model).

Thanks!
